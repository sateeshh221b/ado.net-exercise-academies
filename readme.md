## Seed code - Boilerplate for Step 6 - Keep Note Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

After exploring the concepts related to ASP.NET Core MVC Application, in our Keep Note application, we will begin with implementing Data Persistence

In this exercise, Data Persistence using ADO.NET is to be implemented  

With ADO.NET, Data Persistence can be implemented using :
1. Connected DataAccess Model
2. Disconnected DataAccess Model


### Problem Statement

In this case study: Keep Note Step 6, the participant has to create two  Repositories for DAL Layer, one for Connected Model and the other for Disconnected Model

**Note: 
  * For detailed clarity on the class files, kindly go thru the Project Structure
  * View Pages and link to these pages are already provided, so participant is not expected to work upon it
**

### Expected solution

A. Create NoteDb Database

B. Add Two Tables with structure provided below:

i. Table Name : Notes

| Column Name   | Data Type     | Size  |
| ------------- |:------------- | -----:|
| NoteID        | int           |       |
| Title         | varchar       |   30  |
| Description   | varchar       |   80  |
| CreatedBy     | int           |       |

ii. Table Name : Users

| Column Name   | Data Type     | Size  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| UserID        | int           |       |
| UserName      | varchar       |   20  |
| Password      | varchar       |   15  |
| EMail         | varchar       |   30  |


C. Add 2 Records to Notes Table with Id : 1001 and 1002

D. Add 2 Records to Users Tables with Id : 101 and 102

E. A NoteRepository with following methods using ADO.NET Connected DataAccess Model

 1. GetAllNotes()       : It should fetch all Note Records
 2. AddNote()           : It should add Note to Notes Table 
 
F. A UserRepository with following methods using ADO.NET Disconnected DataAccess Model

 1. GetAllUsers()       : It should fetch all User Records
 2. AddUser()           : It should add User to User DataSet
 3. SaveChanges()       : It should commit the changes in User Dataset to Users Table
 
### Following are the broad tasks:

1. Creating CRUD Methods for Notes and Users Table
2. CRUD Operations for Notes Table to be implemented through ADO.NET Connected DataAccess Model
3. CRUD Operations for Notes Table to be implemented through ADO.NET Disconnected DataAccess Model


### Steps to be followed :

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder in your local machine.
    Step 2: In NoteRepository, add methods with names suggested here in the section # Expected Solution
    Step 3: In UserRepository, add methods with names suggested here in the section # Expected Solution
    Step 4: Run the testcases for NoteRepository and UserRepository
    

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step6** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_aspnetbytelearning/exercise-6.git`

2. Navigate to exercise-6 folder

    `cd exercise-6`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step6` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step6.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed

### Important instructions for Participants
> - We expect you to write the assignment on your own by following through the guidelines, learning plan, and the practice exercises
> - The code must not be plagirized, the mentors will randomly pick the submissions and may ask you to explain the solution
> - The code must be properly indented, code structure maintained as per the boilerplate and properly commented
> - Follow through the problem statement shared with you

### MENTORS TO BEGIN REVIEW YOUR WORK ONLY AFTER ->
> - You add the respective Mentor as a Reporter/Master into your Assignment Repository
> - You have checked your Assignment on the Automated Evaluation Tool - Hobbes (Check for necessary steps in your Boilerplate - README.md file. ) and got the required score - Check with your mentor about the Score you must achieve before it is accepted for Manual Submission.
> - Intimate your Mentor on Slack and/or Send an Email to learner.support@stackroute.in - with your Git URL - Once you done working and is ready for final submission.
